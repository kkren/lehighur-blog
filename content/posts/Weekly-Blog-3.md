Welcome to this week's blog update for our underwater robotics project team! This week has been a flurry of activity as our team gears up for the highly anticipated RoboSub competition. We have successfully booked our flights and hotel accommodations in Santiago, ensuring that we will be well-rested and ready to give our best performance.

Our mechanical team has made significant progress in fine-tuning the electrical harness. The final version has been successfully printed, ensuring seamless and secure component fitting to avoid electrical issues during the competition. We have also implemented Flexseal on the clamps to enhance the stability of the robot's tube, ensuring reliable performance. Also, mechanical team has skillfully cut a bottom window in the tube, allowing the camera to capture clear images of the surroundings. The final assembly is underway, with meticulous integration of components and the addition of a final seal to guarantee watertight integrity for optimal performance in the underwater environment.![img](/assets/Weekly-Blog-3/1.png)

Our software team has been hard at work designing a high-level behavioral tree, which serves as the core framework for autonomous decision-making. To make informed decisions, our robot relies on the data gathered by its onboard camera. The software team has successfully integrated the camera feed into the behavioral tree. This integration ensures that the robot can perceive its environment and respond accordingly, based on the visual information it receives. Also, the software team has implemented algorithms within the behavioral tree that interpret the camera data and translate it into motor commands. This enables our robot to move in a controlled and purposeful manner, adapting to changing conditions and executing tasks effectively.

The electrical engineering team has been diligently working on optimizing the electrical system by implementing connectors in the Electronic Speed Controllers (ESC). These connectors allow for quick disconnects, enabling easy removal and replacement of ESC units when necessary. This advancement simplifies troubleshooting and enhances the overall flexibility of our robot's electrical setup. To protect the delicate electronic components from water and ensure their functionality in the underwater environment, our electrical engineering team has started the process of integrating the electronics inside the robot's tube. This step is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the electronic system and safeguarding it from potential water damage.

As we approach the RoboSub competition, the collaborative efforts of our team across mechanical, software, and electrical engineering are driving us towards a powerful and capable underwater robot.
