The Underwater Robot Research Team made significant progress in the areas of electrical, mechanical, and software development this week. This report summarizes the key progress made in each domain, showcasing our team's dedication and expertise.

In the electrical domain, we successfully reattached all components to the sled and implemented improved cable management techniques. This reattachment process ensures a secure and organized configuration for the electrical system. Additionally, we addressed the issue with the lighting system and successfully fixed it, resulting in proper illumination for underwater operations.

Regarding the mechanical aspects, we accomplished the crucial task of waterproofing the entire system. Through meticulous sealing procedures, we have enhanced the system's resilience against water ingress. Furthermore, we conducted comprehensive pressure testing on each individual component to verify their integrity and eliminate any potential leaks. This testing procedure ensures the system's durability and reliability in various underwater conditions.

In terms of software development, we initiated the coding process for the Robot Operating System (ROS) and began writing the main code base. The ROS framework provides a robust foundation for managing and controlling the software components of the underwater robot. Our efforts in developing the main code base will enable us to control the robot's operations autonomously. This code will incorporate essential functionalities such as autonomous navigation, data acquisition, and communication.

Moving forward, we plan to continue optimizing the electrical connections and cable management to improve reliability and minimize signal interference. Additionally, we will conduct further testing to validate the waterproofing effectiveness in different underwater environments. In the software domain, we aim to progress the ROS code development, ensuring seamless integration between software modules and sensors. Furthermore, we will expand the main code base to include features like obstacle avoidance, path planning, and data processing.

Throughout the week, we encountered some challenges, particularly in adjusting the component attachments to the sled. However, we successfully resolved these minor issues, resulting in an optimally functioning system. Another challenge we faced was ensuring complete water resistance during mechanical testing, but our meticulous attention to detail and rigorous testing procedures helped overcome these challenges.

To conclude, the Underwater Robot Research Team has achieved significant milestones in the areas of electrical, mechanical, and software development. The improvements in cable management, light fixing, waterproofing, and pressure testing have enhanced the system's reliability and durability. The initiation of ROS code development and the commencement of the main code base mark important progress in the software aspect of the project. The team remains committed to overcoming challenges and achieving our objectives in the upcoming weeks.
