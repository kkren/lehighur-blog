The week commencing July 1, 2023, witnessed a concerted focus on one of the key aspects of our Underwater Drone Development Project: addressing the waterproofing capabilities. Waterproofing is not only paramount to the operational effectiveness of the drone but also its durability and longevity in underwater environments.

Our objective this week was unambiguous: to rigorously test and subsequently improve the waterproofing around a critical component â€“ the connector between the wire and the underwater drone tank. Failures in this component could be catastrophic, leading to leaks that could damage internal electronics and compromise the drone's functionality.

To achieve this goal, we developed and implemented a simple yet effective testing protocol. Our approach involved wrapping paper towels around the connector area. Paper towels, due to their excellent water absorption capabilities, serve as an excellent tool to detect water leakage. Even minimal leakage would result in visible wetness on the towels, allowing us to quickly identify and address the problem areas.

After setting up the test, the fully assembled drone was submerged in the pool. This procedure allowed us to mimic the operational conditions the drone would face in real-world underwater explorations. As the drone remained submerged, our team carefully monitored the paper towel-wrapped connectors for any signs of moisture.

This week's focus on waterproofing has been a critical step in our project. While the results are currently being evaluated, this endeavor allowed us to make strides in improving the overall design and functionality of our underwater drone. Further updates will be shared in our upcoming reports as we continue to push the boundaries of underwater exploration technology.
